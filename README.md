Hello I am Servet Görkem PALAZ , I firstly specify that I have some experience for c# as much as I can use methods and parameters . As you see there are some methods , do while loop and others . I just didn't find how to remove numbers from table , when I removed them the system goes wrong :( , That's all what I said , thank you very much , Sincereley
